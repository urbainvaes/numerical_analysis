\chapter*{Acknowledgments}%
\label{cha:acknowledgements}

I am grateful to Vincent Legat, Tony Lelièvre, Gabriel Stoltz and Paul Van Dooren for allowing me to draw inspiration from their lectures notes in numerical analysis.
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        \Cref{cha:solution_of_nonlinear_systems} of these notes follows closely the structure of~\cite[Chapter 3]{VanDooren}.

    \item
        The presentation of the material in~\cref{cha:interpolation_and_approximation} is based on~\cite{Legat}.

    \item
        \Cref{cha:ode} is based on~\cite[Chapter 2]{cs} and~\cite[Chapter 5]{VanDooren}.

    \item
        \Cref{cha:Optimization} is based on~\cite[Chapter 3]{cs}.
\end{itemize}
I would also like to thank Jean-François Barthélémy and Kh\^oi Nguy\~{\^e}n,
who made contributions to several chapters,
as well as the students who found several errors and typos in these notes.
