\chapter*{Acknowledgments}%
\label{cha:acknowledgements}

I am grateful to Vincent Legat, Tony Leli√®vre, Gabriel Stoltz and Paul Van Dooren for allowing me to draw inspiration from their lectures notes in numerical analysis.
\Cref{cha:solution_of_nonlinear_systems} of these notes follows closely the structure of~\cite[Chapter 3]{VanDooren},
and the presentation of the material in~\cref{cha:interpolation_and_approximation} is based on~\cite{Legat}.
I would also like to thank the following students who found errors and typos in the lecture notes:
Claire Chen, Qinyu Chen, Jinqiao Cheng, Paul Dai, Anthony Francis, Hannah Ernst, Marco He, Wenye Jiang, Steven Li, Yiran Liu, Tingche Lyu, Nikki Tai, Alice Wang, Anita Ye, Yuejia Zhang and Linda Zhao.
